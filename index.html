            <p class="novel">I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of
                Orion. I watched
                C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time... like
                tears in rain... <span>Time to die.</span></p>
            <p class="novel">I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in those last moments he loved life more than he

                before.
                Not just his life - anybody's life; my life. All he'd wanted were the same answers...</p>
